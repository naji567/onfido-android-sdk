- UI: Fixed bug causing overlapping screens when using 26+ support library versions

## [2.1.0]

### Added
- Public: Added `withApplicant(String id)` method to `OnfidoConfig.Builder`, in order to allow users to start a flow with a previously-created `Applicant`.
- Documentation: Added SDK localisation instructions in the `README.md`.

### Deprecated
- Public: Deprecated `withApplicant(Applicant applicant)` method on `OnfidoConfig.Builder`, in favor of newly-created `withApplicant(String id)`.

is still available and is equivalent to `new FaceCaptureStep(FaceCaptureVariant.PHOTO)`
